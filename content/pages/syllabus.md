## Course Description

This will be an introductory course in generalized geometry, with a special emphasis on Dirac geometry, as developed by Courant, Weinstein, and Severa, as well as generalized complex geometry, as introduced by Hitchin. Dirac geometry is based on the idea of unifying the geometry of a Poisson structure with that of a closed 2-form, whereas generalized complex geometry unifies complex and symplectic geometry. For this reason, the latter is intimately related to the ideas of mirror symmetry. The basic reference will be an article by M. Gualtieri, as listed under textbooks but we will also draw from more recent developments in the physics literature. A basic familiarity with complex and symplectic manifolds will be assumed.
